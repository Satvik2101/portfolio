    <h2 id="key-takeaways-notes">Key Takeaways/ Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional Psychology views events as Cause-Emotion-Effect. Waiter
            spilled coffee over me, I got angry, and I shouted on him. This is
            termed Aetiology . Teleology, or Adlerian psychology, takes a different
            approach. It follows Cause-Goal-Emotion. The waiter spilled coffee over
            me. In my mind, I formed a goal to make the waiter regret his mistake. I
            made myself angry because anger was the best emotion to achieve that
            goal.</li>
        <li>We are one. We are not separate from our mind, we are not separate
            from our emotions. We are a unified whole. We cannot say “The emotion
            made me do it.” The emotion is part of us.</li>
        <li>The past is the past. Trauma is in the past. It does not matter. If
            the past created our personalities, the world would be reduced to
            determinism. Traumatic experiences have influence, but it is upto us
            what that influence is. We make our life what it is.</li>
        <li>The world isn’t complicated. We find it complicated because we make
            it seem complicated.</li>
        <li>Sometimes we may choose unhappiness. “I am happy when I’m unhappy”.
            Because despite the inconveniences, we judge our current
            lifestyle/personality to be the best,easiest and most practical way to
            handle the world. It’s like being stuck in a local minima and unable to
            find the global (or even a better local). But this is a good thing.
            Because if we chose our lifestyle, <em>we can choose it all over
                again</em>. Anyone can decide at any moment to change. All we have to do
            is to power through our brain’s resistance to it.</li>
        <li>You need the courage to be happy.</li>
        <li>We enter this world as helpless beings. All humans strive to move
            forward from this state of helplessness. This is called pursuit of
            superiority. We always want to better ourself. Feelings of inferiority
            are also useful in bettering ourself. But, prolonged feelings of
            inferiority may form an inferiority complex, which is bad.
            <ul>
                <li>Feeling of inferiority - I’m not well educated, so I need to work
                    harder than others.</li>
                <li>Inferiority Complex - I’m not well educated, so I can’t get a good
                    job and have a good life.</li>
                <li>Also related to superiority complex, a fabricated sense of
                    superiority. <strong>No man who must say I am the King is a true
                        king</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Think of people as your comrades. Don’t consider them
            competition.</li>
        <li>Anger is a tool used for achieving a goal. That goal can be realized
            without anger too.</li>
        <li>Separate tasks. Some tasks are yours, some belong to other people.
            Don’t intrude on other people’s tasks. Don’t try to do their tasks for
            them. Help them, <em>if they ask</em>. Let them know you are available
            for help, but unless they ask, don’t intrude.</li>
        <li>Live your life the best way you know how. What judgement other
            people pass on it is their task.</li>
        <li>A stone on a hill rolls down. It cannot stop itself. It gives into
            the <em>inclination</em>. But we are humans, we are capable of resisting
            inclination.</li>
        <li>Not wanting to be disliked is a natural desire (an inclination), but
            we must resist it. If we live our life in a way that people won’t
            dislike us, we will be living life according to them. If we aren’t
            living life for ourself, then who is living for us? <strong>Freedom is
                being disliked by other people</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I don’t want to be disliked, but I don’t mind if I am</li>
                <li>Not wanting to be disliked is my task. Whether a person dislikes me
                    or not is their task.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We have a sense of worth when we feel we can contribute to the
            community.</li>
        <li>Contribute to others doesn’t mean self-sacrifice.</li>
        <li>Happiness is the feeling of contribution.</li>
        <li>Live the moments. If your goal is to get to the top of the mountain
            top, you can take a helicopter ride there, stay for 5 minutes, and
            helicopter back. If you don’t make it to the top, you’ve failed.
            Instead, if your goal is to simply <em>climb</em> the mountain, you
            won’t fail. And you can enjoy and grow from the climb.</li>
        <li>Whatever meaning life has is given it to it by the individual.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="all-notes">All Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Yes, this world is astonishingly simply and life itself is,
                too.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>PHILOSOPHER: There is no change in what I say. The world is
                simple and life is simple too.</p>
            <p>YOUTH: How? Anyone can see that it’s a chaotic mass of
                contradictions.</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHER: That is not because the world is complicated. It’s
                because you are making the world complicated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Your friend had the goal of not going out beforehand, and he’s
                been manufacturing a state of anxiety and fear as a means to achieve
                that goal. In Adlerian psychology, this is called ‘teleology’.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>self being determined not by our experiences themselves, but by
                the meaning we give them. He is not saying that the experience of a
                horrible calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have
                no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong. But
                the important thing is that nothing is actually determined by those
                influences. We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give
                to those past experiences</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You did not fly into a rage and then start shouting. It is solely
                that you got angry so that you could shout. In other words, in order to
                fulfil the goal of shouting, you created the emotion of anger. The goal
                of shouting came before anything else. That is to say, by shouting, you
                wanted to make the waiter submit to you and listen to what you had to
                say. As a means to do that, you fabricated the emotion of
                anger.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>At some stage in your life, you chose ‘being unhappy’. It is not
                because you were born into unhappy circumstances or ended up in an
                unhappy situation. It’s that you judged ‘being unhappy’ to be good for
                you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You’re telling me, ‘You chose that lifestyle yourself, so go
                ahead and select a new one instantly,’ but there’s no way I can just
                change on the spot!</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHER: Yes, you can. People can change at any time, regardless
                of the environments they are in. You are only unable to change because
                you are making the decision not to.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Although there are some small inconveniences and limitations, you
                probably think that the lifestyle you have now is the most practical
                one, and that it’s just easier to leave things as they are. If you stay
                just like this, experience enables you to respond properly to events as
                they occur, while guessing the results of one’s actions. You could say
                it’s like driving your old, familiar car. It might rattle a bit, but one
                can take that into account and manoeuvre easily. On the other hand, if
                one chooses a new lifestyle, no one can predict what might happen to the
                new self, or have any idea how to deal with events as they arise. It
                will be hard to see ahead to the future, and life will be filled with
                anxiety. A more painful and unhappy life might lie ahead. Simply put,
                people have various complaints about things, but it’s easier and more
                secure to be just the way one is.</p>

        <p>Stuck in a local minima, not even trying to find the global.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>‘Fear of blushing is easy to cure.’ She asked, ‘Really?’ I went
                on: ‘But I will not cure it.’ She pressed me, ‘Why?’ I explained, ‘Look,
                it’s thanks to your fear of blushing that you can accept your
                dissatisfaction with yourself and the world around you, and with a life
                that isn’t going well. It’s thanks to your fear of blushing, and it’s
                caused by it.’ She asked, ‘How could it be … ?’ I went on: ‘If I did
                cure it, and nothing in your situation changed at all, what would you
                do? You’d probably come here again and say, “Give me back my fear of
                blushing.” And that would be beyond my abilities.’</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Your goal is to not get hurt in your relationships with other
                people. Now, how can that goal be realised? The answer is easy. Just
                find your shortcomings, start disliking yourself, and become someone who
                doesn’t enter into interpersonal relationships.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Oh, but being alone isn’t what makes you feel lonely. Loneliness
                is having other people and society and community around you, and having
                a deep sense of being excluded from them. To feel lonely, we need other
                people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Value is something that’s based on a social context. The value
                given to a one-dollar bill is not an objectively attributed value,
                though that might be a commonsense approach. If one considers its actual
                cost as printed material, the value is nowhere near a dollar. If I were
                the only person in this world and no one else existed, I’d probably be
                putting those one-dollar bills in my fireplace in wintertime.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>First of all, people enter this world as helpless beings. And
                people have the universal desire to escape from that helpless state.
                Adler called this the ‘pursuit of superiority’</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>the pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are not
                diseases, but stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth. If it
                is not used in the wrong way, the feeling of inferiority, too, can
                promote striving and growth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>“I’m not well educated, so I’ll just have to try harder than
                anyone else” vs “I’m not well educated, so I can’t succeed, or I’m not
                good-looking, so I can’t get married”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>One makes a show of being on good terms with a powerful person
                (broadly speaking—it could be anyone from the leader of your school
                class to a famous celebrity). And by doing that, one lets it be known
                that one is special. Behaviours like misrepresenting one’s work
                experience or excessive allegiance to particular brands of clothing are
                forms of giving authority, and probably also have aspects of the
                superiority complex. In each case, it isn’t that the ‘I’ is actually
                superior or special. It is only that one is making the ‘I’ look superior
                by linking it to authority. In short, it’s a fabricated feeling of
                superiority.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When one is conscious of competition and victory and defeat, it
                is inevitable that feelings of inferiority will arise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>PHILOSOPHER: For instance, a child will tease an adult with
                various pranks and misbehaviours. In many cases, this is something done
                with the goal of getting attention, and will cease just before the adult
                gets genuinely angry. However, if the child does not stop before the
                adult gets genuinely angry, then his goal is actually to get in a
                fight.</p>
            <p>YOUTH: Why would he want to get in a fight?</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHER: He wants to win. He wants to prove his power by
                winning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When you control your anger, you’re ‘bearing it’, right? Instead,
                let’s learn a way to settle things without using the emotion of anger.
                Because after all, anger is a tool. A means for achieving a
                goal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Dostoevsky - Money is coined freedom</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you are not living your life for yourself, then who is going
                to live it for you?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Separation of tasks - whose task is this?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Studying is the child’s task. A parent’s handling of that by
                commanding the child to study is, in effect, an act of intruding on
                another person’s task. One is unlikely to avert a collision in this way.
                We need to think with the perspective of ‘whose task is this?’ and
                continually separate one’s own tasks from other people’s tasks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>One does not intrude on other people’s tasks. That’s
                all.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>One has to pay attention. Adlerian psychology does not recommend
                the non-interference approach. Non-interference is the attitude of not
                knowing, and not even being interested in knowing what the child is
                doing. Instead, it is by knowing what the child is doing that one
                protects him. If it’s studying that is the issue, one tells the child
                that that is his task, and one lets him know that one is ready to assist
                him whenever he has the urge to study. But one must not intrude on the
                child’s task. When no requests are being made, it does not do to meddle
                in things.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him

        <li>
            <p>Well, let’s exaggerate it and say they were vehemently opposed.
                Your father was ranting and raving with emotion, and your mother was
                protesting your decision with tears in her eyes. They absolutely do not
                approve of you becoming a librarian, and if you will not take on the
                family business like your brother has, they may very well disown you.
                <strong>But how to come to terms with the emotion of ‘not approving’ is
                    your parents’ task, not yours.</strong> It is not a problem for you to
                worry about<br />
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>All you can do with regard to your own life is choose the best
                path that you believe in. On the other hand, what kind of judgement do
                other people pass on that choice? That is the task of other people, and
                is not a matter you can do anything about.</p>

            <p>he learned of a chariot enshrined in the acropolis. The chariot
                had been secured tightly to a pillar in the temple by Gordias, the
                former king, and there was a local legend that said, ‘He who unravels
                this knot shall be master of Asia.’ It was a tightly wound knot that
                many men of skill had been certain they could unbind, but no one had
                succeeded. Now, what do you think Alexander the Great did when he stood
                before this knot? As soon as Alexander the Great saw how tight the knot
                was, he pulled out his sword and sliced it in half with one stroke.
                Destiny is not something brought about by legend, but by clearing away
                with one’s own sword.’ He had no use for the power of legend, and would
                forge his destiny with his sword.</p>

            <p>Not wanting to be disliked by other people. To human beings, this
                is an entirely natural desire, and an impulse. Kant, the giant of modern
                philosophy, called this desire ‘inclination’. Now, if one were to say
                that living like a stone tumbling downhill and allowing such
                inclinations or desires or impulses to take one wherever they will is
                ‘freedom’, one would be incorrect. To live in such a way is only to be a
                slave to one’s desires and impulses. Real freedom is an attitude akin to
                pushing up one’s tumbling self from below. A stone is powerless. Once it
                has begun to roll downhill, it will continue to roll until released from
                the natural laws of gravity and inertia. But we are not stones. We are
                beings who are capable of resisting inclination.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Freedom is being disliked by other people. It is proof that you
                are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you
                are living in accordance with your own principles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You do not want to be disliked, but you don’t mind if you
                are?</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHER: Yes, that’s right. ‘Not wanting to be disliked’ is
                probably my task, but whether or not so-and-so dislikes me is the other
                person’s task.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Certainly, it is true that the mind and the body are separate
                things, that reason and emotion are different, and that both the
                conscious mind and the unconscious mind exist. That said, however, when
                one flies into a rage and shouts at another person, it is ‘I as a whole’
                who is choosing to shout. One would never think of emotions that somehow
                exist independently—unrelated to one’s intentions, as it were—as having
                produced that shouting voice. When one separates the ‘I’ from ‘emotion’
                and thinks, It was the emotion that made me do it, or The emotion got
                the best of me, and I couldn’t help it, such thinking quickly becomes a
                life-lie.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>YOUTH: So, would you say that people like me, who fear being
                judged by others, are self-centred, too? Even though I try so hard to be
                mindful of others and adjust myself to them?</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHER: Yes. In the sense that you are concerned solely with the
                ‘I’, you are self-centred. You want to be thought well of by others, and
                that is why you worry about the way they look at you. That is not
                concern for others. It is nothing but attachment to self. The fact that
                there are people who do not think well of you is proof that you are
                living in freedom.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The feeling of inferiority is an awareness that arises within
                vertical relationships. If one can build horizontal relationships that
                are ‘equal but not the same’ for all people, there will no longer be any
                room for inferiority complexes to emerge.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It is when one is able to feel I am beneficial to the community
                that one can have a true sense of one’s worth. : That one can act on the
                community; that is to say, on other people, and that one can feel <em>I
                    am of use to someone. I can make contributions to other
                    people.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>So, let’s look at other people not on the ‘level of acts’, but on
                the ‘level of being’. Without judging whether or not other people did
                something, one rejoices in their being there, in their very existence,
                and one calls out to them with words of gratitude.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Suppose your shut-in child helped you wash the dishes after a
                meal. If you were to say then, ‘Enough of that already—just go to
                school,’ you would be using the words of such parents who detract from
                an image of an ideal child. If you were to take such an approach, the
                child would probably end up even more discouraged. However, if you can
                say a straightforward ‘thank you’, the child just might feel his own
                worth, and take a new step forward.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you are building even one vertical relationship with someone,
                before you even notice what is happening, you will be treating all your
                interpersonal relations as vertical. On the other hand, if one has
                managed to build a horizontal relationship with at least one person—if
                one has been able to build a relationship of equals in the true sense of
                the term—that is a major lifestyle transformation. With that
                breakthrough, all one’s interpersonal relations will gradually become
                horizontal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Self-affirmation is making suggestions to oneself, such as ‘I can
                do it’ or ‘I am strong’, even when something is simply beyond one’s
                ability. It is a notion that can bring about a superiority complex, and
                may even be termed a way of living in which one lies to oneself. With
                self-acceptance, on the other hand, if one cannot do something, one is
                simply accepting ‘one’s incapable self’ as is, and moving forward so
                that one can do whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself.
                To put it more simply, say you’ve got a score of sixty per cent, but you
                tell yourself I just happened to get unlucky this time around, and the
                real me is one hundred per cent. That is self-affirmation. By contrast,
                if one accepts oneself as one is, as sixty per cent, and thinks to
                oneself, How should I go about getting closer to one hundred per cent?—
                that is self-acceptance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>It is doing without any set conditions whatsoever when believing
                in others. Even if one does not have sufficient objective grounds for
                trusting someone, one believes. One believes unconditionally without
                concerning oneself with such things as security. That is
                confidence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Adlerian psychology is not saying ‘have confidence in others
                unconditionally’ on the basis of a moralistic system of values.
                Unconditional confidence is a means for making your interpersonal
                relationship with a person better, and for building a horizontal
                relationship. If you do not have the desire to make your relationship
                with that person better, then go ahead and sever it</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Contribution to others does not connote self-sacrifice. Adler
                goes so far as to warn that those who sacrifice their own lives for
                others are people who have conformed to society too much</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>‘If there are ten people, one will be someone who criticises you
                no matter what you do. This person will come to dislike you, and you
                will not learn to like him either. Then, there will be two others who
                accept everything about you and whom you accept too, and you will become
                close friends with them. The remaining seven people will be neither of
                these types.’ Now, do you focus on the one person who dislikes you? Do
                you pay more attention to the two who love you? Or would you focus on
                the crowd, the other seven? A person who is lacking in harmony of life
                will see only the one person he dislikes, and will make a judgement of
                the world from that.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You are not the one who decides if your contributions are of use.
                That is the task of other people</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a word, happiness is the feeling of contribution. That is the
                definition of happiness.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>All types of problem behaviour, from refusing to attend school,
                to wrist-cutting, to underage drinking and smoking and so on, are forms
                of the pursuit of easy superiority</p>

        <li>
            <p>Life is a series of moments</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>these people have lived each and every instant of their lives
                here and now? That is to say, rather than living lives that are ‘en
                route’, they are always living here and now. For example, the person who
                had dreams of becoming a violinist was always looking at pieces of
                music, and concentrating on each piece, and on each and every measure
                and note.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If the goal of climbing a mountain were to get to the top, that
                would be a kinetic act. To take it to the extreme, it wouldn’t matter if
                you went to the mountaintop in a helicopter, stayed there for five
                minutes or so, and then headed back in the helicopter again. Of course,
                if you didn’t make it to the mountaintop, that would mean the
                mountain-climbing expedition was a failure. However, if the goal is
                mountain climbing itself, and not just getting to the top, one could say
                it is energeial. In this case, in the end it doesn’t matter whether one
                makes it to the mountaintop or not.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For example, one wants to get into a university, but one makes no
                attempt to study. This an attitude of not living earnestly here and now.
                Of course, maybe the entrance examination is still far off. Maybe one is
                not sure what needs to be studied or how thoroughly, and one finds it
                troublesome. However, it is enough to do it little by little—every day
                one can work out some mathematical formulas; one can memorise some
                words. In short, one can dance the dance. By doing so, one is sure to
                have a sense of ‘this is what I did today’; this is what today, this
                single day, was for. Clearly, today is not for an entrance examination
                in the distant future. And the same thing would hold true for your
                father, too—he was likely dancing earnestly the dance of his everyday
                work. He lived earnestly here and now, without having a grand objective
                or the need to achieve that objective. And, if that was the case, it
                would seem that your father’s life was a happy one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The greatest life-lie of all is to not live here and now. It is
                to look at the past and the future, cast a dim light on one’s entire
                life, and believe that one has been able to see something.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>And Adler, having stated that ‘life in general has no meaning’,
                then continues, ‘Whatever meaning life has must be assigned to it by the
                individual.’</p>
