    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Businesses built on repeatable processes, rules, that basically
                need a person to just sit there and fill a seat, and do nothing more
                than be a drone with a pulse, you will need to produce a product without
                humanity, without personalization. You’ll need to lower prices and race
                to the bottom. Great businesses strive to race to the top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Markets need human beings, not drones. They need people who are
                remarkable. With AI being able to do more and more stuff, being human is
                the only thing we can do to stand out. Whatever AI can do, it can’t be
                human. Don’t be a robot. BE HUMAN</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Consumer Culture</strong> - We’ve been taught to consume
                for happiness. The burst of dopamine, the instant gratification received
                from consuming is a modern-day curse that people view as a boon.</p>
            <p>As factories began getting more and more efficient, the capitalists
                realized soon they would have more stuff than there was demand for it.
                Consumer culture was the solution. Once a person in your town has a car,
                others needed one too. Consumer culture is based on <em>invented
                    needs</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When you ask someone to change something in an existing product,
                framework, or procedure - you give them a little bit of freedom and
                autonomy, ask for creativity or originality - more likely than not
                they’ll change something so little it’s barely noticeable to anyone who
                isn’t well-versed with the original. This is because they’re afraid -
                they keep their range of motion small. Don’t do that. Don’t be afraid to
                go big. Don’t be the guy who changes the tiniest surface element instead
                of finding a creative solution that goes into the depth of the
                problem.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>We should only learn two things in life - to solve interesting
                problems, and to lead. The only reason to learn trigonometry or calculus
                is because it is an interesting problem, one worth solving. Once you’ve
                solved it - move on to the next interesting problem.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A brilliant author or businesswoman or senator or software
                engineer is brilliant only in tiny bursts. The rest of the time, they’re
                doing work that most any trained person could do.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Instead of telling your team what to do, build a team that can
                figure out what to do instead.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fear will always exist before doing something crazy, unique, or
                original. Instead of ignoring it, hiding it, or worse, succumbing to it
                - ask yourself “where do I put the fear?” Feel the fear, acknowledge it,
                then proceed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Gifts allow you to make art. Gifts are given with no reciprocity
                hoped for or even possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In everything you do, it’s possible to be an artist, at least a
                little</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The only purpose of starting is to finish, and while the projects
                we do are never really finished, they must ship.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Allow people to “thrash”, i.e criticize. But not too late into
                the project, and don’t allow everyone to thrash. Limit the number of
                thrashers, even well meaning people with authority.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Failing counts as the thing being “done”. So fail.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You need to come up with 1000 bad ideas before you come up with 1
                good one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Accept that everything is a draft</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Manipulated art ceases to be art.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Annoyed at Humans</strong> - When fire burns us, we get
                annoyed at ourselves. But it wouldn’t do us any good to be annoyed at
                the fire. We give the fire a pass, because we know fire will burn, it’s
                not gonna change. Human beings are also the same, they aren’t gonna
                change. When our responses become lessons we try to teach people, we
                lose. If the projector stopped working in a meeting, you’d be somewhat
                annoyed, but you’d go on. But if the technician forgot to set up
                something, you’d be angry at him. Seething. It doesn’t make any
                sense.</p>
            <p>We get a limited number of brain cycles everyday. It doesn’t make
                sense to waste many of them on situations beyond our control.</p>

        <li>
            <p>If you build a business filled with rules and procedures that are
                designed to allow you to hire cheap people, you will have to produce a
                product without humanity or personalization or connection. Which means
                that you’ll have to lower your prices to compete. Which leads to a race
                to the bottom. Indispensable businesses race to the top
                instead.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If we can measure it, we can do it faster. If we can put it in a
                manual, we can outsource it. If we can outsource it, we can get it
                cheaper.</p>

            <p>The experience could have been merely ordinary, merely another
                bit of good -enough. But it’s not. It’s magical. It was created by
                someone who cared, who contributed, who did more than he was told. A

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Passion is caring enough about your art that you will do almost

        <li>
            <p>This means being willing to surrender elements that you are in

            <p>You’ve probably guessed what happens when you have a great backup
                plan: You end up settling for the backup. As soon as you say, “I’ll try
                my best,” instead of “I will,” you’ve opened the door for the
                lizard.</p>

            <p>One way to become creative is to discipline yourself to generate
                bad ideas. The worse the better. Do it a lot and magically you’ll

            <p>Spend hours on obsessive data collection. (Jeffrey Eisenberg
                reports that “79 percent of businesses obsessively capture Internet
                traffic data, yet only 30 percent of them changed their sites as a
                result of analysis.”)</p>

        <li>
            <p>Ship deliberately average work product that will certainly fit in

            <p>Criticize anyone who is doing something differently. If they

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so accept

            <p>It takes crazy discipline to do nothing between projects. It
                means that you have to face a blank wall and you can’t look busy. It
                means you are alone with your thoughts, and it means that a new project,
                perhaps a great project, will appear pretty soon, because your restless
                energy can’t permit you to only sit and do nothing.</p>

        <li>
            <p>The second approach is to sit with the anxiety, don’t run from
                it. Acknowledge it, explore it, befriend it. It’s there, you’re used to
                it, move on. No rewards for worriers. No</p>

            <p>“Thanks for the feedback, boss,” you say. Then you repeat the

                you walk away. It</p>

            <p>Then say, “If I deliver what you approved, on budget and on time,
                will you ship it?” Don’t proceed until you get a yes. Iterate if you
                must, but don’t get started simply because you’re in a hurry. Do not
                accept “Well, I’ll know it when I see it.” Not allowed.</p>

            <p>Linus and the core team responsible for Linux will never need to
                look for work again, because as you give more and more to the

            <p>Our inclination is to give fire a pass, because it’s not human.

            <p>The whiner has no passion, but is extremely attached to the
                worldview he’s bought into. Living life in fear of change, the whiner
                can’t muster the effort to make things better, but is extremely focused
                on wishing that things stay as they are. I’d put most people in the
                newspaper industry in this corner. They stood by for years, watching the
                industry crumble while they resolutely did nothing except whine about
                unfairness. Almost all the positive change in this industry (like The
                Huffington Post and YouTube) is coming from outsiders.</p>

            <p>The same mindset that drives someone to stay in their home during
                a hurricane is at work. Just because you want something to be true

            <p>The linchpin has figured out that we get only a certain number of
                brain cycles to spend each day. Spending even one on a situation out of
                our control has a significant opportunity cost.</p>

            <p>Author Steven Johnson hates the board game Candyland and all
                board games like it. I hate them even more than he does. “I realize that
                games of pure chance have a long history, but that doesn’t make them any
                less moronic,” he writes. Here’s how Candyland is played: You pick a
                card and do what it says. Repeat.</p>

            <p>The world just gave you control over the means of production. Not

            <p>Patients who were given colostomies (an operation in which a
                large portion of the colon is removed) were measured on their long -term
                happiness. The patients who were told that the situation was permanent,
                that they would need to live with a bag their entire lives, ended up
                being happier than those who were told that there was a chance they’d
                recover use of their colon. The stressful part is the hoping.</p>

            <p>Anyway, near the beginning of most of these comics was a scene
                where a stranger would meet the team. Inevitably, the heroes would
                introduce themselves. Of course, Batman or Superman wouldn’t need an
                introduction, but the lesser (lower -rent) heroes had to speak up and
                describe their superpowers. “I’m the Wasp. I have the ability to shrink
                to a height of several centimeters, fly by means of insectoid wings, and
                fire energy blasts.” Some fancy marketers might call this a positioning
                statement or a unique selling proposition. Of course, it’s not that.
                It’s a superpower. When you meet someone, you need to have a superpower.
                If you don’t, you’re just another handshake.</p>

        <li>
            <p>When you talk to people who are committed to their art, what
                you’ll discover is this: they never stop giving. They don’t give for a
                while, hoping to get, and then, once they cross a threshold, become
                takers. Instead, they have a posture of always giving. That’s what they
                do, because they are artists, not cogs. They are linchpins, not
                replaceable employees.</p>
