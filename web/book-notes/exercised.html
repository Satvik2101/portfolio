<ul>
<li><p>we never evolved to exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>exercise today is most commonly defined as voluntary physical
activity undertaken for the sake of health and fitness.</p></li>
<li><p>[in the old days] no one ever ran or walked several miles just
for health.</p></li>
<li><p>how would I explain to a hunter-gatherer, a farmer in Pemja, or
even my great-great-great-grandparents that I spend most of my days
sitting in chairs and then compensate for my idleness by paying money to
go to a gym to make myself sweaty, tired, and uncomfortable on a machine
that forces me to struggle to stay in the same place?</p></li>
<li><p>many of our beliefs and attitudes about exercise are myths. Chief
among these myths is the notion that we are supposed to want to
exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>If exercise, as we are told, is really a “magic pill” that will
cure or prevent most diseases, why are more people living longer than
ever despite being more physically inactive than ever?</p></li>
<li><p>nothing about the biology of exercise makes sense except in the
light of evolution, and nothing about exercise as a behavior makes sense
except in the light of anthropology.</p></li>
<li><p>the myth of the athletic savage. The essential premise of this
myth is that people like the Tarahumara whose bodies are untainted by
modern decadent lifestyles are natural superathletes, not only capable
of amazing physical feats, but also free from laziness. By contending
that the men I observed running seventy miles</p></li>
<li><p>without training do so naturally, this myth implies that people
like you and me who neither can nor will accomplish such feats are, from
an evolutionary perspective, abnormal because civilization has turned us
into etiolated wimps. As you have probably divined, I object to the myth
of the athletic savage. For one, it stereotypes and dehumanizes people
such as the Tarahumara. Since that first trip when I spoke with Ernesto,
I have talked with hundreds of Tarahumara all over the Sierra Tarahumara
and can assure you no one there wakes up in the morning and thinks,
“Gee, what a beautiful day. I think I’ll run fifty miles just for fun.”
They don’t even go for needless five-mile runs. When I ask Tarahumara on
what occasions they run, the most common answer is “when I chase goats.”
Instead, I have come to appreciate that the Tarahumara are extremely
hardworking, physically fit farmers who never do anything by half and
whose culture deeply values running. The reason some Tarahumara run
fifty or more miles on rare occasions is not much different from the
reason Ironmen do triathlons: they think it is worth it. However,
whereas Ironmen subject themselves to full triathlons to test their
limits (Anything Is Possible!), Tarahumara run rarájiparis because it is
a deeply spiritual ceremony that they consider a powerful form of
prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>The myth of the athletic savage mistakenly suggests that humans
uncorrupted by civilization can easily run ultramarathons, scale
enormous mountains, and perform other seemingly superhuman feats without
training.</p></li>
<li><p>In other words, the training that enables them to run
back-to-back marathons is the physical work that is part and parcel of
their everyday life.</p></li>
<li><p>In other words, typical hunter-gatherers are about as physically
active as Americans or Europeans who include about an hour of exercise
in their daily routine.</p></li>
<li><p>we walk less, drive more, and use countless energy-saving devices
from shopping carts to elevators that whittle away, calorie by calorie,
at how much physical activity we do. The problem, of course, is that
physical activity helps slow aging and promotes fitness and health. So
those of us who no longer engage in physical labor to survive must now
weirdly choose to engage in unnecessary physical activity for the sake
of health and fitness. In other words, exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>First, while youngsters have always played and sports are a human
universal, exercise outside the context of sports was extremely rare
until relatively recently. Second, as recent technological and social
developments have diminished industrialized people’s need to be
physically active, a growing chorus of experts has never ceased to raise
the alarm that we aren’t exercising enough.</p></li>
<li><p>“there never was a time in the history of the world when the
great mass of mankind could meet the simple exigencies of life with so
little expenditure of time and energy as today,” and that “without solid
physical education programs, people would become fat, deformed, and
clumsy.”</p></li>
<li><p>Just as we put wheels in cages for mice in labs, over the
centuries we have invented a stunning variety of ways and means for our
fellow humans to undertake optional physical activity for the sake of
health and fitness.</p></li>
<li><p>Unsurprisingly, exercise has become increasingly advertised as
virtuous and has been commodified, commercialized, and industrialized.
To use the weight machines, treadmills, ellipticals, and other
contraptions in the gym around the corner from my house costs seventy
dollars per month. When I head out for a morning run, I wear specialized
running shoes, chafe-preventing shorts, a snazzy moisture-wicking shirt,
a washable cap, and an expensive watch that connects to satellites
overhead to track my speed and distance. Oscar Wilde once quipped, “I
approve of any activity that requires the wearing of special clothing,”
but I suspect even he would be shocked at the popularity of
“athleisure”—workout clothes for everyday activities like sitting that
help us look athletic without ever having to break a sweat. Worldwide,
people spend trillions of dollars a year on fitness and
sportswear.</p></li>
<li><p>What would my distant hunter-gatherer ancestors have thought of
paying lots of money to suffer through needless physical activity on an
annoying machine that gets us nowhere and accomplishes nothing?</p></li>
<li><p>MYTH #2 It Is Unnatural to Be Indolent</p></li>
<li><p>To be more precise, we’d ask you to drink some very expensive,
harmless water that contains a known quantity of rare (heavy) hydrogen
and oxygen atoms and then collect samples of your urine over the next
few days. This sounds like a creepy magic trick, but by measuring the
rate at which these heavy atoms become less abundant in urine, we can
calculate the rates at which both the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms
leave the body from sweating, urinating, and breathing. Because hydrogen
exits the body only in water but oxygen leaves in both water and carbon
dioxide, the difference in the concentration of these two atoms in urine
allows us to compute exactly how much carbon dioxide someone produced
from breathing, hence how much energy he or she used.</p></li>
<li><p>even if you are a highly active person, you probably spend more
energy maintaining your body than doing stuff. Understandably, this fact
seems counterintuitive. As I sit here writing these words, there is
little visible evidence that every one of my body’s systems is working
industriously to keep me alive apart from the fifteen to twenty gentle
breaths I take every minute. Yet my heart is contracting sixty times a
minute to pump blood to every corner of my body, my intestines are
digesting my last meal, my liver and kidneys are regulating and
filtering my blood, my fingernails are growing, my brain is processing
these words, and countless other cells in every tissue of my body are
busily replenishing themselves, repairing damage, fending off infection,
and monitoring what’s going on.</p></li>
<li><p>The key lesson to digest from the starving men’s dramatically
lower resting metabolic rates is that human resting metabolisms are
flexible. Most critically, resting metabolism is what the body has opted
to spend on maintenance, not what it needs to spend.</p></li>
<li><p>Stated simply, we evolved to be as inactive as possible. Or to be
more precise, our bodies were selected to spend enough but not too much
energy on nonreproductive functions including physical
activity.</p></li>
<li><p>ancient, fundamental strategy to allocate scarce energy sensibly.
Apart from youthful tendencies to play and other social reasons (topics
for later chapters), the instinct to avoid nonessential physical
activity has been a pragmatic adaptation for millions of
generations.</p></li>
<li><p>But then I wondered if I was being one of those annoying
exercists who nags people (in this case myself) to sneak in more
physical activity by parking at the back of the lot. How did something
as normal and instinctive as saving energy become associated with the
sin of slothfulness?</p></li>
<li><p>To early Christian thinkers like Thomas Aquinas, sloth had
nothing to do with physical laziness, but instead was a sort of mental
apathy, a lack of interest in the world. By this definition, sloth is
sinful by causing us to neglect the pursuit of God’s work. It was only
later that sloth came to mean the avoidance of physical work, perhaps
because almost no one back then, apart from a few elites, could avoid
regular physical labor.</p></li>
<li><p>So let’s banish the myth that resting, relaxing, taking it easy,
or whatever you want to call inactivity is an unnatural, indolent
absence of physical activity.</p></li>
<li><p>MYTH #3 Sitting Is Intrinsically Unhealthy</p></li>
<li><p>Technically, “inflammation” describes how the immune system first
reacts after it detects a harmful pathogen, something noxious, or a
damaged tissue. In most cases, inflammation is rapid and vigorous.
Whether the offenders are viruses, bacteria, or sunburns, the immune
system quickly launches an armada of cells into battle. These cells
discharge a barrage of compounds that cause blood vessels to dilate and
become more permeable to white blood cells that swoop in to destroy any
invaders. This extra blood flow brings critically needed immune cells
and fluids, but the swelling compresses nerves and causes the four
cardinal symptoms of inflammation (which literally means “to set on
fire”): redness, heat, swelling, and pain.</p></li>
<li><p>As scientists started to study when and how cytokines turn
inflammation on and off, they discovered that some of the same cytokines
that ignite short-lived, intense, and local inflammatory responses
following an infection also stimulate lasting, barely detectable levels
of inflammation throughout the body. Instead of blazing acutely in one
spot for a few days or weeks, as when we fight a cold, inflammation can
smolder imperceptibly in many parts of the body for months or years. In
a way, chronic, low-grade inflammation is like having a never-ending
cold so mild you never notice its existence.</p></li>
<li><p>The mechanisms by which too much fat, especially in and around
organs, can ignite low-grade, chronic inflammation suggest that too much
sitting may be hazardous simply because it causes weight gain.</p></li>
<li><p>the hormone cortisol. This much-misunderstood hormone doesn’t
cause stress but instead is produced when we are stressed, and it
evolved to help us cope with threatening situations by making energy
available.</p></li>
<li><p>Cortisol shunts sugar and fats into the bloodstream, it makes us
crave sugar-rich and fat-rich foods, and it directs us to store organ
fat rather than subcutaneous fat.</p></li>
<li><p>Consequently, long hours of stressful sitting while commuting or
a high-pressure office job can be a double whammy.</p></li>
<li><p>muscles regulate inflammation during bouts of moderate to intense
physical activity similarly to the way the immune system mounts an
inflammatory response to an infection or a wound.</p></li>
<li><p>If I gulp down four cups of coffee all at once, I’ll become
jittery and get a headache, but if I drink them over the course of a
day, I’ll be fine. Is the same true for sitting? Additionally, does a
daily bout of hard exercise negate the effects of sitting for the rest
of the day?</p></li>
<li><p>Even those who engaged in more than seven hours per week of
moderate or vigorous exercise had a 50 percent higher risk of dying from
cardiovascular disease if they otherwise sat a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Altogether, these and other alarming studies suggest that even if
you are physically active and fit, the more time you spend sitting in a
chair, the higher your risk of chronic illnesses linked to inflammation,
including some forms of cancer. If these results are correct, then
exercise alone doesn’t counter all the negative effects of
sitting.</p></li>
<li><p>These activities aren’t serious exercise, but experiments that
ask people to interrupt long periods of sitting even briefly—for
example, just a hundred seconds every half hour—result in lower levels
of sugar, fat, and so-called bad cholesterol in their blood. In turn,
less circulating blood sugar and fat prevent inflammation as well as
obesity. In addition, small and occasional bouts of moving stimulate
muscles to</p></li>
<li><p>quench inflammation and reduce physiological stress.</p></li>
<li><p>For this reason, squatting and other more active forms of sitting
may be healthier than sitting in chairs by requiring intermittent muscle
activity, especially in the calves, thus recirculating blood in the
legs.</p></li>
<li><p>Another way to sit actively is to fidget, or do what researchers
drily term “spontaneous physical activity.”</p></li>
<li><p>that simply fidgeting while seated can expend as much as twenty
calories an hour as well as promote beneficial levels of blood flow to
restless arms and legs. One study even found a 30 percent lower rate of
all-cause mortality among people who fidget after adjusting for other
forms of physical activity, smoking, diet, and alcohol
consumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Standing is not exercise, and as yet no well-designed, careful
study has shown that standing desks confer substantial health
benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>One massive fifteen-year-long study of more than ten thousand
Danes found no association between time spent sitting at work and heart
disease.</p></li>
<li><p>An even bigger study on sixty-six thousand middle-aged Japanese
office</p></li>
<li><p>workers yielded similar results. Instead, leisure-time sitting
best predicts mortality, suggesting that socioeconomic status and
exercise habits in mornings, evenings, and weekends have important
health effects beyond how much one sits during weekdays at the
office.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep: Why Stress Thwarts Rest</p></li>
<li><p>I sometimes experience this phenomenon when I stay up late trying
to comprehend complex information (like how sleep affects the brain). As
the night progresses, my brain becomes increasingly muddled, and
eventually I give up and go to bed. But then in the morning, almost
miraculously, everything seems to make sense. What happened while I was
asleep?</p></li>
<li><p>For every hour spent awake storing memories and amassing waste,
we need approximately fifteen minutes asleep to process those memories
and clean up. That ratio, however, is highly variable: some people like
the elderly sleep less, while others, especially children, need
more.</p></li>
<li><p>College students are a special breed of humans, in part because
so many of them are enjoying their first taste of being grown up without
yet shouldering the responsibilities of being adults.</p></li>
<li><p>“In twenty years, people will look back on the sleeping-pill era
as we now look back on the acceptance of cigarette smoking.”</p></li>
<li><p>We label sitting as bad and sleeping as good. In truth, both ways
of resting are utterly normal but highly variable behaviors with complex
costs and benefits that are strongly influenced by our environment and
contemporary cultural norms.</p></li>
<li><p>It bears repeating that sleep and physical activity are
inextricably linked: the more physically active we are, the better we
sleep because physical activity builds up sleep pressure and reduces
chronic stress, hence insomnia. In that sense, physical activity and
sleep are not trade-offs but collaborators. Maybe it is not so
paradoxical that the same well-intentioned people who nag us to exercise
sometimes also badger us to spend more time in bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Wondering how lions could develop such strength without using
weights, Angelo figured they must get strong by “pitting one muscle
against another.” He started to experiment with what he called “dynamic
tension,” which today we call isometric training.</p></li>
<li><p>When asked to do as many push-ups, pull-ups, and chin-ups as they
could, the Aché were fit but similar to Westerners with one important
difference: as they aged, their strength declined at lower rates,
presumably reflecting how they stay physically active throughout the
life span including middle age.</p></li>
<li><p>One potential drawback of bulking up too much is sacrificing
power. Strength is how much force I can produce; power is how rapidly I
produce it. Strength and power are not independent, but there is some
trade-off between the two:</p></li>
<li><p>Indeed, aging does not put an end to muscles’ capacity to respond
to resistance exercise; instead, modest levels of resistance exercise
slow and sometimes reverse sarcopenia regardless of age they would
probably be confused by how we spend money to needlessly lift things
whose sole purpose is to be lifted.</p></li>
<li><p>Humans are endurance walkers.</p></li>
<li><p>“Walking on a regular basis—whether going for a brisk, structured
walk, or just fitting in more steps every day—can help you shed pounds
and inches and, most importantly, keep them off.”</p></li>
<li><p>MYTH #10 It’s Normal to Be Less Active as We Age</p></li>
<li><p>Hippocrates wrote twenty-five hundred years ago, “Eating alone
will not make a man well; he must also take exercise.”</p></li>
<li><p>Endurance promotes endurance.</p></li>
<li><p>If exercise is so destructive, why is it healthy? One explanation
is that once she stopped exercising, my wife’s body reacted by repairing
whatever harm she caused and, crucially, also repairing some of the
damage that she had accumulated beforehand when she wasn’t exercising.
As a result, she restored many tissues to their previous state.</p></li>
<li><p>his advocacy of vitamin C was quackery. Dozens of studies have
found that taking antioxidant pills is no substitute for physical
activity to fight senescence. A comprehensive review published in
examined sixty-eight clinical trials that compared the effects of
commonly prescribed antioxidants like vitamin C with placebos on more
than 230,000 people. Three or four studies reported a modest benefit,
but the rest found that antioxidants provided no benefit or even
increased the risk of dying.</p></li>
<li><p>This shift, in which more of us live longer but die from chronic
rather than infectious diseases, thus extending morbidity, is known as
the epidemiological transition and widely hailed as medical
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1984, he and his students began studying more than five
hundred members of amateur running clubs along with more than four
hundred healthy but physically inactive controls. Back then, the
subjects were over the age of fifty and healthy: few smoked, none drank
heavily, and none were obese. Then, for the next twenty-one years, Fries
and his colleagues patiently kept track of each subject’s physical
activity habits, administered a yearly disability questionnaire that
measures functions like the ability to walk, dress, and do routine
activities, and recorded the year and cause of every death that
occurred. Fries and colleagues had to wait two decades for the results,
but I have summarized them for you instantaneously in figure 29. They
are worth a careful look. The top graph plots the runners’ and
non-runners’ probability of not dying in a given year against time; the
graph below plots disability against time. As you can see, the healthy
non-runners died at increasingly faster rates than the runners and by
the study’s end were about three times more likely to pass away in a
given year. In terms of cause of death, the non-runners were more than
twice as likely to die of heart disease, about twice as likely to die of
cancers, and more than three times as likely to die of neurological
diseases. In addition, they were more than ten times as likely to die of
infections like pneumonia. Just as important, the disability scores
plotted on the bottom show that the non-runners lost functional capacity
at double the rate of the runners. By the end of the study their
disability scores were more than twice as high as the runners’,
indicating that the runners’ bodies were approximately fifteen years
younger by this measure. In sum, running caused a compression of
morbidity, thus also extending lives.</p></li>
<li><p>MYTH #11 “Just Do It” Works</p></li>
<li><p>“exercise is done against one’s wishes and maintained only
because the alternative is worse.”</p></li>
<li><p>our bodies never evolved to function optimally without lifelong
physical activity but our minds never evolved to get us moving unless it
is necessary, pleasurable, or otherwise rewarding.</p></li>
<li><p>If we can’t make exercise necessary and fun, perhaps we can make
it more necessary and more fun.</p></li>
<li><p>I think there is a deeper evolutionary explanation for why almost
every book, website, article, and podcast on how to encourage exercise
advises doing it in a group. Humans are intensely social creatures, and
more than any other species we cooperate with unrelated strangers. We
used to hunt and gather together, and we still share food, shelter, and
other resources, we help raise one another’s children, we fight
together, we play together. As a result, we have been selected to enjoy
doing activities in groups, to assist one another, and to care what
others think of us. 15 Physical activities like exercise are no
exception.</p></li>
<li><p>Dopamine. This molecule is the linchpin of the brain’s reward
system. It tells a region deep in the brain “do that again.” First,
dopamine levels go up only while we exercise. So they don’t get us off
the couch. Worse, dopamine receptors in the brain are less active in
people who haven’t been exercising than in fit people who are regularly
active. And to add insult to injury, people who are obese have fewer
active dopamine receptors.</p></li>
<li><p>Serotonin. This still mysterious neurotransmitter helps us feel
pleasure and control impulses, but it also affects memory, sleep, and
other functions. Our brains produce serotonin when we engage in
beneficial behaviors like having physical contact with loved ones,
taking care of infants, spending time outdoors in natural light, and,
yes, exercising.</p></li>
<li><p>Although some people with depression take pharmaceuticals to
maintain normal serotonin function, exercise has been shown to be often
as effective as any prescription.</p></li>
<li><p>Endorphins. Endorphins are natural opioids that help us tolerate
the discomfort of exertion. The body’s own opioids are less strong than
heroin, codeine, and morphine, but they too blunt pain and produce
feelings of euphoria.</p></li>
<li><p>endorphins aren’t produced until after twenty or more minutes of
intense, vigorous activity, making them more rewarding for people who
are already fit enough to work out that hard.</p></li>
<li><p>Endocannabinoids. For years, endorphins were thought to cause the
infamous runner’s high, but it is now evident that endocannabinoids—the
body’s natural version of marijuana’s active ingredient—play a much
greater role in this phenomenon. 24 Despite causing a truly pleasurable
high, this system has little relevance for most exercisers because it
usually takes several hours of vigorous physical activity before the
brain releases these mood-and sensory-enhancing drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>While these and other chemicals released by exercise help us
exercise, their drawback is they mostly function through virtuous
cycles. When we do something like walk or run six miles, we produce
dopamine, serotonin, and other chemicals that make us feel good and more
likely to do it again. When we are sedentary, however, a vicious cycle
ensues. As we become more out of shape, our brains become less able to
reward us for exercising. It’s a classic mismatch: because few of our
ancestors were physically inactive and unfit, the brain’s hedonic
response to exercise never evolved to work well in persistently
sedentary individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Commonly recommended, sensible methods to make exercise more fun
(or less unfun) include: Be social: exercise with friends, a group, or a
good, qualified trainer. 27 Entertain yourself: listen to music,
podcasts, or books, or watch a movie. Exercise outside in a beautiful
environment. Dance or play sports and games. Because variety is
enjoyable, experiment and mix things up. Choose realistic goals based on
time, not performance, so you don’t set yourself up for disappointment.
Reward yourself for exercising.</p></li>
<li><p>Because we never evolved to be inactive and out of shape, the
adaptations that make physical activity feel rewarding and become a
habit develop only after the several months of effort it takes to
improve fitness. Slowly and gradually, exercise switches from being a
negative feedback loop in which discomfort and lack of reward inhibit us
from exercising again to being a positive feedback loop in which
exercise becomes satisfying.</p></li>
<li><p>No matter what we do to make exercise more enjoyable, the
prospect of exercising usually seems less desirable and less comfortable
than staying put. Every time I plan to exercise, I first struggle to
prevail over instincts to not exercise. Afterward, I never regret it,
but to overcome my inertia, I usually have to figure out how to make it
seem necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>From a purely utilitarian perspective, how is requiring exercise
different from mandating seat belt use?</p></li>
<li><p>MYTH #12 There Is an Optimal Dose and Type of Exercise</p></li>
<li><p>All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the
dose permits something not to be poisonous.</p></li>
<li><p>Paffenbarger published many brilliant studies (including one
contending that regular chocolate consumption adds nearly a year to your
life3),</p></li>
<li><p>Middle-aged alumni who exercised more than two thousand calories
per week had a 21 percent lower risk of dying than their sedentary
classmates, and those who were over seventy and exercised the same
amount had half the risk of dying in a given year as their inactive
classmates. alumni who reported they exercised moderately or vigorously
did better than their classmates who exercised only lightly. Finally,
alumni who took up exercise later in life had similarly lower rates of
mortality compared to those who had been active all along. It’s never
too late to start.</p></li>
<li><p>By the 1990s, so many studies had accumulated that three major
health organizations decided to convene expert panels to review the
evidence and make recommendations. In 1995 and 1996, all three panels
published essentially the same advice: to reduce the overall risk of
chronic disease, adults should engage in at least 30 minutes of
moderate-intensity exercise at least five times a week. 6 They also
concluded that children should engage in 60 minutes of physical activity
a day. the study further concluded that half an hour of vigorous
exercise and an hour of moderate exercise confer the same
benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>In the final analysis, exercising a minimum of 150 minutes per
week is as good a prescription as any and hasthe advantage of being a
clear, attainable dose. But there is no optimal, most beneficial dose of
exercise.People who exercise the least have the most to gain from just
modest added effort, more is better, and the benefits of additional
exercise gradually tail off. “these findings reinforce the notion that
light to moderate doses of exercise have a substantial positive impact
on health but that continued dose escalation appears neither
incrementally better nor worse.”</p></li>
<li><p>marathoners and ultramarathoners had higher rates of
self-reported respiratory tract infections following their grueling
races than fit individuals who exercised more moderately. 16 Additional
studies found lower levels of disease-fighting white blood cells in the
bloodstream and saliva immediately following intense bouts of vigorous
exercise. These and other data led to the hypothesis that the energetic
demands of extreme exercise create a temporary “open window” for
infection.</p></li>
<li><p>That said, there is no question that anyone fighting a serious
infection should avoid overexertion.</p></li>
<li><p>An experiment that gave mice a deadly form of influenza and then
forced them to exercise before their symptoms developed found that low
levels of moderate exercise (twenty to thirty minutes of daily running)
doubled their rate of survival compared to sedentary mice, but extremely
high levels of exercise (two and a half hours of running a day) caused
them to die at even higher rates.</p></li>
<li><p>In the eighteenth century it was fashionable to lift church bells
that were silenced (made “dumb”) by having their clappers removed, hence
the term “dumbbells.”</p></li>
<li><p>Given that each of us is an “experiment of one” with different
backgrounds, goals, and predilections that change with age, there can be
no optimal mixture of exercise type any more than there can be an
optimal amount.</p></li>
<li><p>Make exercise necessary and fun. Do mostly cardio, but also some
weights. Some is better than none. Keep it up as you age.</p></li>
