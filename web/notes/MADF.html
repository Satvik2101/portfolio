            <p>In general, spread spectrum has <strong>spreading codes</strong>,

            <p>However, the 802.11 standard publicly describes the spreading codes
                so that interoperable 802.11 components can be created. An attacker with
                a radio compliant with 802.11 would be able to connect.</p>

            <h4 id="steps-to-attack-wep.">Steps to attack WEP.</h4>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    <p>Hacker runs Kismet to discover WLANs in the area. He gets its
                        SSID, channel number and its BSSID (Basic SSID - the Ethernet
                        Address).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>APs can hide their SSIDs, using an option called SSID
                        Cloaking/SSID Broadcast Disable.</p>
                    <p>If this is the case, the attacker has to wait for a client to connect
                        to the AP (the client and the AP will both disclose the SSID). The
                        attacker can also force an already connected client to reconnect. This
                        is done by sending a packet to the client, pretending to be from the AP.
                        The packet tells the client that they have lost their connection with
                        the AP (<strong><em>You are no longer connected</em></strong>). The
                        client attempts to reconnect, and exposes the SSID.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The attacker puts his wireless card into Monitor mode. The card
                        will eavesdrop on the WLAN (even without connecting to it.) He makes the
                        card monitor the channel on which the target AP is. All the traffic
                        monitored is saved in a <em>capture file.</em></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>WEP uses Initialization Vectors (IVs), which are values used to
                        start a cryptographic process. When a certain number of weak IVs have
                        been captured, we can determine the WEP key. 125k packets are needed to
                        crack 40-bit WEP keys. 200-250k packets for 128-bit WEP keys.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the WLAN is slow, the hacker will need to accelerate the
                        attack to capture the right amount of weak IVs. The attacker will inject
                        already captured WEP frame back into the network. WEP has no replay
                        protection mechanism.</p>
                    <p>512 packets injected per second - 10 mins for 40-bit keys, 30 mins
                        for 128-bit keys.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>After sufficient amount of IVs are captured, the attacker runs
                        AirCrack, which will attempt to crack and return the WEP key. Once the
                        key is known, the attacker can connect to the AP in the same way a
                        legitimate client would.</p>

            <h2 id="sms-security-issues">SMS Security Issues</h2>
            <p>SMS is a store and forward service. The SMS is stored in a server
                first, before being forwarded to the receiver. This is necessary in case
                the receiver’s mobile phone is out of coverage or switched off when the
                SMS is sent.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SMC</strong> - Short Message Center. This is where the SMSes
                    are sent to be stored, before they are forwarded.</li>
                <li><strong>SME</strong> - Short Message Entity. This is an application
                    or program that generates an SMS message. It can be a mobile phone, a
                    computer, or a service network.</li>
                <li><strong>GMSC</strong> - Gateway Short Message Service (Actual full
                    form is Gateway Mobile Switching Center)- acts as an interface between
                    different networks. It uses the HLR (Home location register) to
                    determine the recipient’s network, and forwards the message there.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="availability-issues">Availability Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Many attacks try to create a DoS scenario.</li>
                <li>They may send thousands of messages to a particular user, using
                    software or the Internet. If it is an older device, it’s memory will
                    fill up and it will be unable to accept more messages.</li>
                <li>With modern devices, the recipient will have difficulty identifying
                    which SMSes are real and meant for him, and which are fake.</li>
                <li>The attacker may trick the OS/device into blocking actions until the
                    SMSes are deleted. These messages usually contain special characters or
                    symbols, long names, or do not follow standard structure for an SMS
                    message.</li>
                <li>Silent DoS is also possible, where the phone works normally but
                    doesn’t receive any SMS.</li>
                <li>Continuous messaging can also drain the battery.</li>
                <li>DoS can be done by installing a fake base station, or a jamming
                    device that makes the user unable to send or receive SMSes.</li>
                <li>Sometimes DoS can happen without any attack on the system, for e.g,
                    on holidays when millions of SMSes are sent together which causes delay
                    and overload in the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="confidentiality-issues">Confidentiality Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Encryption for SMS/Voice calls are usually done between the phone
                        and the provider network (if done at all). Once in the network, the data
                        is unencrypted. Employees of the provider may have access to
                        it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>An attacker can hack an employee’s mobile phone to gain access to
                        the network and view other people’s SMSes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fake base stations can also be used by attackers to intercept and
                        read SMSes. The attacker can also forward the SMS to the actual
                        recipient to avoid any suspicion, using various techniques to hide his
                        identity (SMS Masquerading)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Even without knowing the content of SMS we can learn about the
                        user’s habits, such as when they switch their phone off and when they
                        switch it on. A switched off phone will not receive an SMS, and the SMS
                        will be marked as <em>delivered</em> only after the phone is switched
                        on.</p>
                    <p>Attackers usually send <em>invisible</em> messages for this purpose,
                        which do not show anything on the screen and don’t show any notification
                        either.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Mobile operators are sometimes required to share details of SMSes
                        viewed and sent by a person for law enforcement. Even without operator’s
                        help, there are ways to view deleted messages from a device.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="integrity-issues">Integrity Issues</h3>
            <p>Integrity issues are those relating to an SMS’s content being
                changed, or the sender is pretending to be someone else.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SMS Spoofing</strong> is when a sender masquerades as
                    another sender. Using the internet we can send messages in bulk using a
                    number of our choice. Since this can be abused, operators now ask for
                    some alphabets to be added in the ID along with digits. To combat this,
                    fraudsters are using O instead of 0 and I instead of 1. The catalog’s
                    functionality can also be exploited, as the catalog only matches the
                    last 4 digits. So, an attacker sending a message using AA5483 will be
                    matched by a catalog containing an entry for 88885483</li>
                <li>Attackers can also connect directly to a messaging center and use
                    spoofing techniques to hide their identity, and pretend to be someone
                    else. We can check if the number of the SMS, and the country of the
                    message center match. For e.g, if the number is from Greece, but the
                    message center is from Japan, we can figure out something is wrong.
                    Timestamps can also be used, since message centers timestamp using their
                    local time. If a message arrives from an Indian number , to an Indian
                    receiver, with a timestamp of 2 hours before, we can guess that
                    something is wrong (since it should have the same timestamp as the
                    current time)</li>
                <li>Cipher can be used to change phone settings, such as turning
                    ciphering indicator on or off.</li>
                <li>Special binary messages can also be sent using SMS. They don’t
                    appear to the user, but go directly to the phone or SIM card. OTA
                    updates of software were done using this method, but this can also be
                    exploited by hackers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="other-security-issues">Other Security Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SMSes that can be modified/deleted later, but stay in the same
                    memory location. Their initial use was for stuff like news, stocks,
                    weather, where the SMS’s content would change daily and the user
                    wouldn’t have to wait for a new SMS to arrive. They can obviously be
                    misused.</li>
                <li>SMSes that show on the screen directly without any warning (flash
                    SMS), without the user going into messages. These make the user think
                    these are from the provider and hackers can trick users into calling
                    certain numbers or paying money, etc.</li>
                <li>SMSes can be used to influence outcome of contests or voting
                    procedures that allow SMS. Bulk messages can be sent for a particular
                    participant.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="sms-spamming">SMS Spamming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spam is unsolicited commercial messages from unknown senders.</li>
                <li>Spam is profitable and can be completely anonymous.</li>
                <li>Internet sites allowing users to download free ringtones ask for
                    their phone number, then sell that phone number to spammers.</li>
                <li>SMS spam filtering is more difficult than email spam filtering
                    because SMSes are short so we have less information. ML algorithms such
                    as Bayesian networks have proven effective.</li>
                <li>Techniques of protecting SMSC from spam sometimes use blacklisted
                    words, which ends up blocking legitimate messages containing those
                    words. Challenge/response protocols have been suggested.</li>
                <li>Many providers allow users to report spam, or stop SMS service
                    altogether. Some also allow SMS aliases. Only messages sent to the alias
                    are delivered, those sent to the number aren’t.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A promising scheme is shown below.</p>

                <li>Originator’s phone number and the SMSC used are compared. If the
                    originator sent a message earlier using a different SMSC, the message is

                <li>SMSC and originator country is checked and compared.</li>

                <li>Timezone is checked. If the sender and receiver country are same,
                    but the timestamp from SMSC is more than 1 minute ahead, the message is
                    suspicoius.</li>
                <li>Keyword blacklist.</li>
                <li>HTTP links are checked.</li>
                <li>SMS Protocol is checked (TP-PID). Some SMSes, such as silent SMSes,

                <li>We try to avoid any data loss.</li>
                <li>First thing to do is to ensure the phone is isolated from the
                    network.</li>
                <li>If the phone is on, memory and SIM card is examined first.</li>
                <li>If the phone is off and the owner doesn’t reveal the pincode, we
                    need to ask for help from the provider.</li>
                <li>Each step should be photographed or videoed, even in the case of
                    automatic data analysis.</li>
                <li>If the phone was deactivated, SIM analysis takes place first.
                    Activating the phone may cause change in data, such as in Location Area
                    Information file. If we place a different SIM, we may lose data such as
                    call history.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="preserving-data-and-isolating-from-network">Preserving data and
                isolating from network</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Only qualified software should be used.</li>
                <li>If the phone is not compatible with specialized software, test the
                    methods on a test phone first before executing it on the real
                    device.</li>
                <li>New data from the network, such as phone calls, emails, SMSes, etc.
                    must be avoided. They an also be used to delete or modify the data on
                    the device. Therefore, we need to isolate the device from the
                    network.</li>
                <li>Best solution is to use a Faraday cage.</li>
                <li>Phone should be charged constantly to avoid it turning off. We need
                    to avoid any signal entering the phone using the charging cable. This is
                    done by placing a power source inside the Faraday cage</li>
                <li>Jammers can also be used instead of Faraday cages.</li>
                <li>In modern phones we can also use flight mode.</li>
                <li>We can collaborate with the network to disable network access to the
                    phone. We can also use a special SIM that activates the device but
                    doesn’t allow network access. This may lead to loss of data such as call
                    logs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="identify-the-phone">Identify the phone</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to identify it visually</li>
                <li>Look up different mobile phones’ photographs online</li>
                <li>Take out the battery and see the IMEI and MAC address, and identify
                    using those.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Typing *#06## also reveals the IMEI</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>User manuals and characteristics of the phone must be studied, so we
                    know what kind of data loss is possible. Test device is still
                    recommended,</li>
                <li>Use manufacturer’s cables instead of local ones. Connecting via WiFi
                    and Bluetooth should be avoided as it will write data to the phone’s
                    memory.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="examine-sim-card-and-memory">Examine SIM Card and Memory</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Get PIN for phone and sim from user. If user doesn’t cooperate,
                    contact provider.</li>
                <li>User should not be allowed to touch the phone</li>
                <li>SIM provides access to its data through its own microcontroller,
                    therefore it cannot be cloned. The analysis has to take place on the
                    original SIM card.</li>
                <li>Hashes are used to check if two sets of files are identical or
                    not.</li>
                <li>The process must be filmed.</li>
                <li>Extracting the sim generally involved removing the battery, which
                    may lead to loss in data. In these cases, the data in the mobile must be
                    analyzed before the SIM card.</li>
                <li>After extraction of data with automated tools, manual extraction
                    must also be done to find data that the software missed.</li>
                <li>Extracted evidence must be verified, such as with the network
                    operator.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="sim-card">SIM Card</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot be cloned</li>
                <li>Contains EEPROM memory</li>
                <li>SIM is protected by 4 or 6-digit PIN that the user can set. After 3
                    wrong entries of PIN, the SIM will lock itself. To unlock it, we need a
                    PUK (Pin Unblocking Key), which is an 8-digit key. After 10 unsuccessful
                    entries of PUK, the SIM card will become unusable.</li>
                <li>PUK and PIN are both initially set by the SIM manufacturer, but the
                    user can change them.</li>
                <li>ADM code is known only to the manufacturer, and it provides complete
                    access to all data as well as their modification.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="files-present-in-sim-card">Files Present in SIM Card</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Files are present in directories and subdirectories, similar to in
                    computers.</li>
                <li>MF stands for Master File and represents the root directory. DF
                    (Dedicated File) are subdirectories. EF (Elementary File) are the actual
                    files.</li>
                <li>Some files can be read without any authentication. Some need the SIM
                    PIN. The most important files need the ADM code which only the provider
                    has.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SIM contains many files such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Card’s serial number</li>
                <li>List of providers and their names</li>
                <li>Default network</li>
                <li>Default language</li>
                <li>Contacts</li>
                <li>Messages</li>
                <li>Settings for messages</li>
                <li>List of last outgoing calls</li>
                <li>Temporary identity (IMSI-TMSI) (International Mobile Subscriber
                    Identity - Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)</li>
                <li>Coarse location (Location Area Identifier)</li>
                <li>Control Channels (BCCH)</li>
                <li>Current Encryption Key (<span class="math inline">\(K_c\)</span>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Around 100 files are present, but each provider can also add their
                own files. Users generally can’t access or delete these files, which
                makes them important.</p>
            <h4 id="imsi">IMSI</h4>
            <p>International Mobile Subscriber Identity (15-digit number) is used to
                uniquely identify the SIM internationally.</p>
            <p>It consists of MCC + MNC + MSIN.</p>
            <p>MCC - Mobile Country Code (3-digit). MNC - Mobile Network Code
                (2-digit , 3-digit for USA and Canada). MSIN is 10 digit (9 in
                USA/Canada)</p>
            <h4 id="iccid">ICCID</h4>
            <p>Integrated Circuit Card Identifier. It is a unique serial number that
                is printed on the plastic wrapping of the card. It identifies the actual
                printed circuit.</p>
            <p>It consists of :</p>
            <p>89 + MCC + MNC + Serial Number</p>
            <p>89 is fixed and represents that this circuit (the SIM) is used for
                telecommunication.</p>
            <h4 id="location-information-file-and-bcch-file">Location Information
                File and BCCH File</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LIF (Location Information File) stores the last TMSI and last LAI.
                    TMSI is a temporary identity that is used for security purposes, so we
                    don’t transmit the permanent identity of the user again and again.</li>
                <li>LAI = MCC + MNC + LAC (Location Area Code)</li>
                <li>LAC gives a wide area which can have many phones.</li>
                <li>BCCH list stores the current BCCH and its six neighboring channels.
                    By combining BCCH and LAC information we can get a better idea of where
                    the phone was.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="sms-storage-file">SMS Storage File</h4>
            <p>Modern SIMs can store SMS, usually upto 35. The first byte of each
                SMS storage slot tells the message’s status.</p>
            <p>00000000 - Empty Slot</p>
            <p>00000001 - Read incoming message</p>
            <p>00000011 - Unread incoming message</p>
            <p>00000101 - Outgoing message that has been sent</p>
            <p>00000111 - Outgoing message which hasn’t been sent.</p>
            <p>If a message is deleted by the user, usually the first byte’s last
                bit is changed to 0, which marks the slot as empty. But the actual
                content of the slots aren’t changed. So, by reading data directly, we
                can sometimes get old messages that the user thinks have been
                deleted.</p>
            <p>Another file stores SMS Settings, such as the default alphabet,
                message center number, etc.</p>
            <h4 id="contact-list">Contact List</h4>
            <p>SIM Cards can store contact. Old SIMs stored upto 100, newer ones
                offer 250. When a contact is deleted, the slot is filled with binary
                “1”, so deleted contact cannot be recovered. But slots are assigned in
                order, so if we find an empty slot between slot 34 and 36, we can assume
                there was a contact in slot 35 that has been deleted.</p>
            <h4 id="outgoing-calls">Outgoing Calls</h4>
            <p>SIMs can store the last 10 dialled numbers. Most manufacturers prefer
                to use the phone’s memory of this. SIM doesn’t store incoming calls,
                only outgoing.</p>
            <h3 id="device-data">Device Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Contains messages, emails, IMEI, call logs, contact, pictures,
                    application files, etc.</li>
                <li>Deleted information can be recovered from the depths of memory.</li>
                <li>Data should be recovered without altering</li>
                <li>Memory can be cloned, unlike with SIM</li>
                <li>Official and unofficial tools exist for memory cloning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Issues :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard to detect whether there have been changes in memory during our
                    procedures</li>
                <li>During memory dumps, positions of files may change</li>
                <li>Searching for information in large memory dumps is difficult and
                    time consuming</li>
                <li>Phones may have encrypted memory</li>
            </ul>
            <p>External memory dumps, that use hardware, can be used. In this, the
                memory circuits are desoldered from the phone. This ensures no changes
                occur while doing memory dump. This is less used because we may damage
                the whole memory while performing desoldering.</p>
            <p>External memory cards may be present in the device. Extracting data
                from these is fairly easy.</p>
            <h3 id="evidence-in-operators-network">Evidence in Operator’s
                Network</h3>
            <p>The SIM card operator may also have evidence in their database.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Call logs</li>
                <li>SMS exchanged</li>
                <li>HLR keeps data about IMSI, SIM serial number, PIN and PUK code,
                    etc.</li>
                <li>Call Detail Records (CDR) have all information about the numbers
                    called - date, duration,etc.</li>
